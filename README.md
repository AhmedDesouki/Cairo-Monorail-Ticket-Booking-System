# Cairo-Monorail-Ticket-Booking-System

Description
The monorail system is a complete system that deals with passengers in booking a ticket or 
admins in editing or adding any data related to trains, trips and tickets. The system starts by 
asking the user whether he is a passenger or an admin. The first scenario if the person is a 
passenger, he is asked to login to the system if he already has an account. Or create an account 
if not available. When the passenger logs in to his account he is asked if he wants to book a ticket, 
manage his account, access his tickets' history, or delete a ticket he booked. The second scenario, 
if the person was an admin, he should login first with a pre-created account in the system itself 
and then he is asked if he wants to manage his account, add train, update train, remove train, or 
see reports of the seats booked in each train with the revenues of each route. In the system, a 
person should be a passenger or an admin. Each passenger has an account and a ticket or number 
of tickets that he can reserve in a train, each train has number of seats that might be whether 
reserved or available, an admin responsible of it, and routes that it takes in certain time slots 
with a price that is preset by the admin. A train should have a certain start point and end point 
that passes by multiple stopping stations.


Notes for running 
• We defined only 1 default admin account for our system with:
username: ahmed 
password: ahmed 
• Passengers are able to use the system to create account & login
• The text files contain 1 defined passenger her login credentials are:
Username: mai
Password: mai
• However, if you chose to manually erase these txt files then run, you will need to sign up as a 
passenger first because the defined passenger (mai) won’t be available anymore after the 
deletion of the text files.
• Before booking a ticket please make sure to add trains to the system first, from the admin 
account.
